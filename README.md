# My Personal Project

## My Proposal
**What** will the application do:
- The application generates a list of requirements for the user's flower bouquet which would be given to an external AI application that generates an image based on given the user descriptions.

**Who** will use it:
- Users who would like to create and modify their bouquet without having real life consequences until the bouquet is exactly how they wanted it.

**Why** is this project of interest to you:
- I love flowers but have no idea how to arrange flowers. Since  flowers require water to keep them fresh, it is hard to get practice for arranging flowers without having a lot of them being dried up when I am done practicing. Having this application provides a mean of visualization for the flower bouquet I am trying to arrange while I can put all my effort in focusing the techniques for flower arranging.
