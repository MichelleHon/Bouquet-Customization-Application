# My Personal Project

## My Proposal
**What** will the application do:
- The application is essentially a simulation of an online flower shop that generates a list of requirements for the user's customizeable flower bouquet based on the their input. It would then calculate the bouquet's price and display it on screen.

**Who** will use it:
- Users who would like simulate purchasing a customizable flower bouquet as well as have an approximation for the price of their bouquet. 

**Why** is this project of interest to you:
- I love flowers and love a nice bouquet. This application would allow me to customize a bouquet as well as approximate its cost which would help be to save up for an actual bouquet. 

## User stories
- As a user, I want to be able to *add* a flower to my bouquet.
- As a user, I want to be able to *view* the list of requirements for my bouquet.
- As a user, I want to be able to *remove* a flower from my bouquet.

- As a user, I want to be given the option to *load* my bouquet from file when starting the application.
